### About this Project

Hi, i'm working on this Project/the ATM Project for two or three months now. It's my second big Project after Drippy (https://website.itizye.repl.co/). I learn Python since April 2021 so i used this project to learn mor about Python and its Libarys. First of all i started with the ATM project which is Console-based. As i finished the basics i started this reposit to have everything cleaned up. I'll start working on an advanced design as soon as the programm works fine. Far in the future i want to work on a Data sending System. If you want to help me with that feel free to get a Contributor :)

**How to use the Programm**

First off all make sure to write your name properly. Otherwise the programm won't detect it as your Username. As long as i don't have worked on the Emergency Shutdowns, please be aware that if you don't close the Application via the Logout Button, all your Data will get OTP Encrypted and you will never ever have access to them.
